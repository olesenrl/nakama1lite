A simple Japanese flashcard app I made to learn iOS app development and to review basic Japanese vocabulary. I designed the entire app, including the launch image and other graphics, except for the tab icons from glyphish.com

It follows the Nakama 1 Japanese textbook written by Hatasa, Hatasa, and Makino, available for purchase at www.amazon.com/Nakama-1-Yukiko-Abe-Hatasa/dp/0495798185/
